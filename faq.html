                      Pay-as-you-go plans are our entry-level plans, perfect for
                      those looking for a virtual phone number who don't plan on
                      needing an exceptional number of minutes each month.
                      Pay-as-you-go plans allow you to pay for the minutes as
                      you use them rather than pre-purchasing a set number of
                      minutes every month.

                      For those looking for a certain amount of minutes each
                      month, a minutes-included plan is a perfect option. These
                      plans come in a variety of sizes, from starter packages to
                      medium and large monthly minute packages. If you know the
                      general estimate of minutes you need each month, simply
                      select the plan size that fits your needs. And if you need
                      more minutes than your plan allows for, additional minutes
                      can be purchased on a per-minute basis at a price
                      commensurate with your plan.

                      Annual vs. Monthly Billing
                      <span><i class="fa fa-chevron-down"></i></span>
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                      All of our plans are available to be billed either monthly
                      or annually for a reduced cost. Therefore, if you plan to
                      use roughly the same amount of minutes every month, you
                      can purchase an annual plan at a discounted price compared
                      to a monthly plan of the same size.<br /><br />
                      If you are unsure of how many minutes you will need each
                      month, we recommend starting with a monthly plan. That
                      way, you can scale your minutes as needed. Then once you
                      have a better understanding of how many minutes you need
                      every month, you can switch to an annual plan.
